â€¢	HOWDY Messenger

This messenger is quite simple, but it has some good ideas, and most importantly, it fulfills the basic functions of a messenger: you can create an account and communicate with other users. This website also uses Java Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL. The design is a bit simple, but in this project, I focused on the functionality of the messenger, not the design.
You can find this messenger at https://howdy-messenger-production.up.railway.app, and you can create an account there if you wish.
The home page of the site contains the site logo and two buttons: a registration button and a login button.

When registering, you will be asked to fill out several fields: user name, first name, last name, password, and you can also upload your photo (avatar) if you wish.

After completing registration, the user will be redirected to the site login page, where they must enter their user name and password.

Once logged in, you will have access to your account, where all your data will be visible, as well as access to chats and the ability to log out of your account.

After switching to chats, the user will be shown a list of those with whom he has already corresponded and, accordingly, the last message from him. There is also the option to send a message to a new user if you know his user name.

Also, by clicking on any of the dialogues, you can see all correspondence with this user.
